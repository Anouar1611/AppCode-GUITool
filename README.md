#  How to create a GUI tool(small editor)

### What we are going to build


In this project, we are going to see how to build a `GUI Tool` like a small editor using **Swing** as a GUI widget toolkit for Java. 
This Tool is going to allow users to upload a **Kotlin script** or create a new script and then execute it, and see its output in the console panel.
The editor will be named `Tool`.


### Setup

We are going to use `Maven` as our build tool.

```xml

```

### How to create a graphic design

First of all, we need to create `Swing UI Designer` and then click on `GUI Form`. 
After that, we need to add some components in the **Pallete** such as JPanel, JButton, etc. In parallel, we organize our components in the form.
Finally, we get this design as you can see in the screen below .

###  How to run this tool 


- First, you will need to click of button **Run** in `IntelliJ IDEA` (^R) and you get this interface design:

![Interface GUITool](img/readme/Interface_GUITool.png "Interface GUITool") 

- As you can see, this tool has ***three panel***:

    1. `Menu Panel` contains ***three Button***:
    
        - `File Button`: With this Button , you can upload your script ,or you can create it for the first time.
        
        - `Save Button`: This Button gives you the possibility to edit your script and save it.
        
        - `Run Button`: When you will have your script in **JEditorPane** ,then you can run your script with this Button.   
        
    2. `Editor Code Panel` contains **JEditorPane** which is the main component and gives you the possibility to edit your code.
    
    3. `Output Panel` contains :
    
        - `Text Output`: With this Text Area give you ***four functionality***:
        
            1. Show you live output of your script as it executes.
            
            2. Show errors from the execution when your script couldnâ€™t be interpreted.
            
            3. Show an indication of whether the script is currently running.
            
            4. Show an indication of whether the exit code of the last run was non-zero.
        
        - `Progress Bar`: To visualize the progression of your running script.
